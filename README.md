# Hotel_Reservation_Analysis


In this project, I will use SQL to answer questionsrelated to the dataset. This will help me develop my
data analysis skills in a practical context.

 
# Overview:


The hotel industry relies on data to make informed decisions and provide a better guest experience. In 
this internship, I worked with a hotel reservation dataset to gain insights into guest preferences, 
booking trends and other key factors the impact the hotelâ€™s operations. I will use SQL Server to query 
and analysis the data, as well as answer specific questions about the dataset.

The dataset includes the following columns:

  *Booking_ID: A unique identifier for each hotel reservation.
 
  
  *No_of_adults: The number of adults in the reservation.
  
  *No_of_children: The number of children in the reservation.
